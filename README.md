2. Extract it and run `pomodoro-timer.exe.` That's all there's to it.

## Usage

1. Launch the application by running `pomodoro-timer.exe` inside the `Pomodoro` folder.
2. Click the "Start" button to begin a Pomodoro session.
3. During a session, the timer will count down the work duration.
4. When the work duration ends, an audio and visual notification will alert you.
5. Take a break, move on to the next session.
6. After completing a set number of sessions, the application will track the number of completed Pomodoro cycles as checkmarks.

## Configuration For Developers

You can customize the following parameters in `pomodoro_timer.py` and make a package out of it:

- `WORK_MIN`: Default work duration in minutes.
- `SHORT_BREAK_MIN`: Default break duration in minutes.
- `LONG_BREAK_MIN`: Duration of a long break in minutes (after 4 number of pomodoros).
